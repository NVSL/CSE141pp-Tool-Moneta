# Our Project lies here

Compile the program you want to trace
Start up the notebook and run it

# Setup Information

Before running the notebook, change directory to "setup-files" and run the setup.sh script

```
cd setup-files
./setup.sh
```

Ignore any errors about the directories already existing (there shouldn't be any errors though except the off chance that one of you made these directories in the "/setup/" directory already).
