# This is the README for generating traces and running them.

1. cd /home/jovyan/work/moneta

2. Once in this directory, enter the command moneta. This would automatically start the jupyter notebook.

3. Open the non local host (the IP other than 127.0.0.1) IP in your browser.

4. You should be able to start the Jupyter notebook on your browser.

5. Once inside Moneta, please follow the steps as mentioned in the slides.

6. As an example, generate traces using the following example
	6.1 cd /home/jovyan/CSE141pp-Tool-Moneta/moneta/
	6.2 make
	6.3 cd /home/jovyan/CSE141pp-Tool-Moneta/examples/build/
	6.4 In this directory, we would be able to find the compiled binary files

7. Provide these as input to the Moneta tool once the jupyter notebook starts up.

8. Please refer to the slides and presentation video on how to use Moneta to learn more about memory access patterns.
