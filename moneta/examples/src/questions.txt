Questions:
1. What is the miss rate for one iteration of the outer loop?
2. Is the miss rate of the first iteration of the loop different from the second?
3. Does doubling the block size affect the miss rate? Why/why not?
4. Does doubling the number of cache lines affect the miss rate? Why/why not?
5. How many cache lines are used by A during one iteration of the row loop?
6. What about B?
7. How could you modify the code to minimize the total miss rate with 128 lines and a block size of 64?

transpose pair-wise sum
A+=B.T
