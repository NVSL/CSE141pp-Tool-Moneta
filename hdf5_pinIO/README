Note: the #include in hdf5_pin.h must be updated to point to where H5Cpp.h is in your files

In each directory:
   compile: $h5c++ hdf5_pin.cpp test.cpp
   run: $./a.out
   view ouput file: $h5dump pin_out.h5 | more
 

Test1 contains the version in which a single dataset is created, then extended by size of one memaccess for each memaccess

Test2 contains the version in which a new dataset is created and written for each memaccess

Test3 contains the version in which a large dataset is initially created and each memaccess writes to the dataset

Test4 buffered version in which a dataset is created then extended by a determined number of memaccess, instead of one at a time

Test 5: buffered output by every 200,000 accesses + compound datatypes (isWrite takes one byte and addr is unsigned long long)

Test 8: buffered version with separate datasets for ADDRESS, WRITE (0 for read and 1 for a write), and TAG. This is easiest so far for reading the pin_out.h5 file with Python.

Test9: convert CSV to H5 file, more info in test9 dir README
