Test 9: convert from CSV to H5 file. Choose source csv and destination h5 file names in test.cpp

right now, the setup is 
CSV: tag,R/W,address
H5: Addr  R/W  tag


Have not split R/W into RH, RM, WH, WM yet
R/W is size of one byte, so although CSV values in file.txt test file go up to 1000000, the H5 output only goes up 64

compile with $h5c++ test.cpp hdf5_pin.cpp
