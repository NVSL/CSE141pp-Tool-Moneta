Test 9: convert from CSV to H5 file. Choose source csv and destination h5 file names in test.cpp

Input CSV file format:
	tag,R/W,address

Output H5 file format:
	ADDRESS  WRITE  tag   

	each column is its own dataset in H5 file with the following names:
		ADDRESS = addr,	  size of unsigned long long
		WRITE = R/W/X/S,  size of byte 
		tag = tag,        size of int


compile coverter for cache_dump:
	$h5c++ -o convert convertMain.cpp hdf5_pin.cpp
to run:
$ ./convert csvFileName H5FileName

NOTE: make sure H5 file is not open in jupyter lab if writing to the same H5 file name (an error will be thrown)

---Converting cache_access.out---
to compile:
	$h5c++ -o convertAccesses hdf5_pin.cpp convert_accesses.cpp
to run:
	$./convertAccesses csvFileName H5FileName

The resulting H5 file contains one dataset called ACCESS which contains the first accesses until cache fills
